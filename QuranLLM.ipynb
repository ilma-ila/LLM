            "The Quran addresses the rights of women in several verses, emphasizing their dignity, respect, and equality in the eyes of Allah. Here are some key points regarding women's rights as outlined in the Quran:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Equality**: The Quran states that men and women are created from a single soul, highlighting their inherent equality (4:1).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Inheritance**: Women have a legal right to inherit property. The Quran specifies the shares of inheritance for both men and women, ensuring that women receive their due share (4:7, 4:11).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Dowry**: Women are entitled to receive a dowry (mahr) from their husbands at the time of marriage, which is a form of financial security for them (4:24).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Protection and Maintenance**: Men are described as protectors and maintainers of women, with the responsibility to provide for them financially (4:34).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Marriage**: The Quran allows men to marry multiple women (up to four), but emphasizes the importance of treating all wives fairly and justly (4:3). If a man fears he cannot treat them equally, he is advised to marry only one.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Rights in Marriage**: The Quran encourages kindness and fair treatment towards women. If conflicts arise, it advises reconciliation and provides a process for resolving disputes (4:35).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Respect and Honor**: Women are to be treated with respect and dignity. The Quran commands believers to be good to their wives and to guard them (4:34).\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Spiritual Equality**: The Quran affirms that both men and women are rewarded equally for their good deeds (4:124).\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the Quran emphasizes the importance of justice, kindness, and respect towards women, outlining their rights in various aspects of life, including marriage, inheritance, and personal dignity.\n"
