# LLM PROJECTS 


Be sure to always choose the cheapest versions of models:

For OpenAI: Always use model gpt-4o-mini in the code instead of gpt-4o

For Anthropic: Always use model claude-3-haiku-20240307 in the code instead of the other Claude models

Common tools used in LLM engineering:
Hugging Face – the go-to hub for models, datasets, leaderboards and even applications, and the authors of many essential open source frameworks including the pioneering transformers library
LangChain – open source framework that provides abstractions connecting multiple LLM operations under a simple API
Gradio – a ridiculously simple UI framework that lets you create prototype UIs in one line of code, no frontend experience needed
Alternatives include Streamlit, Dash and most recently Mesop from Google
Weights & Biases – tooling to analyze and visualize during training
Google Colab – write, evaluate and share notebooks remotely on a box in the Google Cloud
Amazon SageMaker is a broader alternative that includes Notebooks
Modal.com the serverless AI platform
